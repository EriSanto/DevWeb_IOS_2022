    <p>We don't talk about Bruno, no, no, no
        We don't talk about Bruno</p>
        <hr>
    <p>  It was my wedding day (it was our wedding day)
        We were getting ready
        And there wasn't a cloud in the sky (no clouds allowed in the sky)
        Bruno walks in with a mischievous grin (thunder)
        You telling this story or am I? (I'm sorry, mi vida, go on)
        Bruno says, "It looks like rain" (why did he tell us?)
        In doing so, he floods my brain (Abuela, get the umbrellas)
        Married in a hurricane (what a joyous day, but anyway) </p>
      
        <h1>NÃ£o falamos do Bruno</h1>

    <p>We don't talk about Bruno, no, no, no
        We don't talk about Bruno
        <hr>
    <p>  Hey, grew to live in fear of Bruno stuttering or stumbling
        I can always hear him sort of muttering and mumbling
        I associate him with the sound of falling sand (tss, tss, tss)
        It's a heavy lift with a gift so humbling
        Always left Abuela and the family fumbling
        Grappling with prophecies they couldn't understand
        Do you understand?
        A seven-foot frame, rats along his back
        When he calls your name it all fades to black
        Yeah, he sees your dreams and feasts on your screams (hey)</p>
